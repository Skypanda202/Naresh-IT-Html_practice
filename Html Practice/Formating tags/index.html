    <h1>The <strong>History</strong> of the <em>Website</em></h1>

    <p>
        The story of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> began when 
        Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a system to share documents across networks. 
        The very first web page went live on <time datetime="1991-08-06">August 6, 1991</time>, 
        hosted on a NeXT computer at CERN. That original page was simple: 
        plain text with links explaining the <var>concept</var> of hypertext, 
        the <code>HTML</code> language, and how to set up a server. 
        In short, the web started as a <em>shared library</em> of information 
        rather than the rich interactive platform we use today.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Years: Text and Links</h2>
    <p>
        In the early 1990s, web pages were primarily text and basic links. 
        Browsers such as <q>Mosaic</q> introduced images inline with text, 
        making pages more engaging. Pages often used simple structural tags like 
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, and authors relied on 
        <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> for emphasis. People described the web as 
        a network of documents — an idea that felt both radical and inevitable.
    </p>

    <h2>Mid-1990s: Browser Wars and New Capabilities</h2>
    <p>
        The mid-90s brought rapid change. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
        competed fiercely, and the pace of innovation accelerated. Web authors experimented 
        with layout techniques (tables and frames), while the arrival of <strong>JavaScript</strong> 
        added basic interactivity. Designers used animated GIFs and embedded media; 
        at the same time, standards like <dfn>HTML 2.0</dfn> and later HTML specs 
        began to formalize how pages should be structured.
    </p>

    <h2>Late 1990s: Style Separation and Interactivity</h2>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>) allowed 
        separation of content and presentation, enabling designers to style text, color, 
        and layout without mixing design into the document structure. Developers wrote 
        scripts to alter page content dynamically; technologies such as <s>server-side includes</s> 
        and client scripting produced richer experiences. This era also saw the birth of many 
        <ins>commercial</ins> web services and early e-commerce sites.
    </p>

    <h2>2000s: Web 2.0 and User Generated Content</h2>
    <p>
        The 2000s are often labeled <q>Web 2.0</q> — a shift toward user-generated content, 
        social platforms, and interactive web applications. Technologies like AJAX allowed 
        pages to update portions of content without full reloads, enabling smoother apps in 
        the browser. Blogs, wikis, and media sharing sites changed how people created and 
        consumed information: anyone could publish. Names like <cite>Wikipedia</cite>, 
        <cite>YouTube</cite>, and <cite>Facebook</cite> became central to the cultural conversation.
    </p>

    <h2>2010s: Mobile, Responsive Design, and HTML5</h2>
    <p>
        With smartphones becoming ubiquitous, designers adopted responsive design to ensure 
        pages worked across screen sizes. HTML5 introduced new semantic tags and APIs 
        (video, audio, canvas) that reduced dependence on plugins. Developers relied on 
        <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> 
        to give content meaning and improve accessibility. The modern website evolved into 
        an application platform capable of offline caching and advanced multimedia.
    </p>

    <h2>Today: Frameworks, Performance, and Progressive Experiences</h2>
    <p>
        Modern sites often use JavaScript frameworks and build tools to produce highly 
        interactive single-page applications. Concepts like progressive web apps (PWAs) 
        blur the line between websites and native applications. Performance, accessibility, 
        and privacy have become major concerns — authors optimize delivery, reduce bloat, 
        and respect user data. Cloud hosting, CDNs, and automated deployment pipelines 
        make it possible to publish global sites quickly.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Technologies Over Time</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong> — the document structure language.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP</strong> — the protocol that transfers resources.</li>
        <li><strong>URLs</strong> — the addressing system for resources.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong> — styling and layout rules.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> — client-side scripting for interactivity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact and Cultural Change</h2>
    <p>
        Websites changed how we communicate, learn, and work. News, commerce, and entertainment 
        migrated online. Small creators found global audiences; businesses rethought distribution. 
        The web made information discoverable and linked ideas in a new way. 
        As one early advocate put it: <q>an open web enables collaboration</q> — 
        a notion that continues to shape policy and design choices.
    </p>

    <h2>Notable Milestones</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>1991:</strong> First web page and server set up at CERN.<br>
        <strong>1993:</strong> Mosaic browser popularizes images inline with text.<br>
        <strong>1995:</strong> JavaScript appears; e-commerce beginnings.<br>
        <strong>1996–1998:</strong> CSS and evolving HTML specs separate structure and presentation.<br>
        <strong>2004–2008:</strong> Rise of social networks, blogs, and video platforms.<br>
        <strong>2010s:</strong> Mobile first design, HTML5, and modern JavaScript frameworks.
    </p>

    <h2>Common HTML Formatting Tags Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>
        This document uses many HTML inline formatting tags: 
        <strong>strong</strong>, <b>b</b>, <em>em</em>, <i>i</i>, <u>u</u>, 
        <mark>mark</mark>, <small>small</small>, <del>del</del>, <ins>ins</ins>, 
        <s>s</s>, H<sub>2</sub>O, E=mc<sup>2</sup>, <code>code</code>, 
        <kbd>kbd</kbd>, <var>var</var>, <samp>samp</samp>, <q>q</q>, <cite>cite</cite>, 
        <abbr>abbr</abbr>, <time>time</time>, <dfn>dfn</dfn>, 
        <bdo dir="rtl">bdo</bdo>, and <span>span</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>
        The web will continue to change. New standards and best practices appear regularly, 
        emphasizing accessibility, performance, and user control. Whether a simple information page 
        or a complex web application, the website remains a flexible medium for expression and service. 
        As the web grows, so does the responsibility of creators to build responsibly — to make sites 
        that are fast, inclusive, and respectful of users.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the end, the website that began as a humble set of linked documents has become a global 
        platform that connects people, powers economies, and enables creativity — and it all started 
        with a few simple <code>tags</code> and a big idea.
